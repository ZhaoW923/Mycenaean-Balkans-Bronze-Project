# GIS Project Files

This folder contains five versions of the QGIS project developed during the spatial analysis phase of the research.

## Version Descriptions

- **V1 – Initial Version**  
  - Basic setup with site locations and metal-related data.

- **V2 – Contextualization**  
  - Background map changed for better clarity.  
  - Added more archaeological sites and metal-related data points.  
  - Marked the research region.

- **V3 – Oxhide Ingots Routes**  
  - Added a layer visualizing known or proposed spread routes of oxhide ingots.

- **V4 – Hypothetical Bronze Spread Routes**  
  - Added another layer mapping hypothetical bronze-related object flows.  
  - Removed modern national boundaries from the basemap.

- **V5 – Final Version with Heatmap**  
  - Included a heatmap showing intensity of metal object discoveries.  
  - Final styling and map composition used in the submitted report.

## Notes

  - Due to GitHub file size limits, the base map layer used in all versions was compressed into a ZIP file (`/GIS/geoBoundaries/geoBoundariesCGAZ_ADM0.zip`).  
  - To fully load the project in QGIS, please download and extract the ZIP file, and ensure the extracted layer is located in the expected path as defined in the project file.  
  - Alternatively, you can re-link the raster manually when open in QGIS.
