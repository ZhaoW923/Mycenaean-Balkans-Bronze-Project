# Mycenaean-Balkans-Bronze-Project

This repository contains the full digital product and scientific report for the MA Project submitted for the Digital Archaeology and Heritage (DAH) track of UvA.

## Project Summary

This project shows the distribution of Mycenaean-style bronze objects, resource flows, and cultural interactions across the Balkans during the Late Bronze Age. It combines spatial analysis (via QGIS) and network analysis (via Gephi) to reconstruct regional contact zones and potential trade routes.

## Repository Structure

- `GIS/`: Five iterative versions of the QGIS project file used for spatial analysis.
- `Network/`: Gephi project and source CSV files used for two-mode network visualizations.
- `Metadata_Tables/`: Raw and processed data tables, including site metadata, artifact records, and cultural features.
- `Visuals/`: Output maps and summary tables used in the report and visualizations.

## How to Use

- Open the `.qgz` files in QGIS.
- Use Gephi to explore the `.gephi` file and CSV node/edge data.
- Refer to the README files in subfolders for detailed metadata and development notes.
